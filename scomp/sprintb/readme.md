### Observations

To execute the program, it is necessary to compile and run it. Using `make run` allows for execution with predefined
configurations. If you wish to modify these configurations, you can adjust the `run` command in the makefile or execute
the program directly via `./prog <<input_dir> <output_dir> <num__child_workers> <time_interval>`.

To run the implemented tests, they must be located outside the directory containing the program but within the same
folder. Additionally, an environmental variable named REPO must be created, specifying the folder containing the
program (in this case `export REPO=sprint2`). Once set up, you can compile and run the tests using `make run`.
