# US G003

## 1. Context

> The purpose of this initial user story is to prepare the program and the developers for upcoming user stories that might necessitate the usage of ANTLR.

## 2. Requirements

*In this section you should present the functionality that is being developed, how do you understand it, as well as possible correlations to other requirements (i.e., dependencies). You should also add acceptance criteria.*

*Example*

**US G003** As Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure to facilitate / accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

 - None specified since this is a user story with the intent to set up and research about technologies that will be used in the future.

**Dependencies/References:**

 - None specified since this is a user story with the intent to set up and research about technologies that will be used in the future.

## 3. Analysis

> For the usage of ANTLR we'll be using ANTLR, version 2.7.7, due to the already existing documentation for it. The dependencies should be added to the POM files in order to support said technology.

> The usage of an already existing plugin is also recommended (ANTLR v4) for a better and more understandable development with ANTLR4.

> For the envisioned servers we'll be using H2 databases. The dependencies should be added to the POM files in order to support said technology.

## 4. Design

> Due to the nature of this user story, this part of the documentation will only explain what was done to set up certain technologies, so the usage of diagrams was considered unnecessary or confusing to the reader.
