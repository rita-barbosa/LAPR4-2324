# US G002


## 1. Context

It is the first time this task was assigned, seeing as this is the first sprint.


## 2. Requirements

**US G002:** As Project Manager, I want the team to use the defined project repository and setup a tool for project management.


## 3. Analysis

For this particular task, we realized the necessity of implementing a tool to 
effectively manage our project. Recognizing that GitHub provides a built-in tool 
called 'Project' designed for this purpose, we decided to use it.


## 4. Design

We opted for a Scrum Board methodology and will incorporate a corresponding template into the project development process.
Furthermore, a 'Testing' column will be introduced specifically for tasks undergoing testing by team members.
Lastly, the issues for the current sprint will be generated and assigned to individual team members following task allocation.

### 4.1. Tests

To ensure the functionality and reliability of the tool, we will implement the practice 
where team members will perform commits that are directly linked with specific issues. 
This approach serves as a crucial step in validating the effectiveness of the tool.
