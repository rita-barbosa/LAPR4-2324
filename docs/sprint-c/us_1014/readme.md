# US 1014

## 1. Context

*This is the first time this user story is being requested.*

## 2. Requirements

**US 1014:** As Customer Manager, I want to record the time and date for an interview with a
candidate.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 1014.1. The user should be registered as a customer manager;
- 1014.2. The system should confirm the operation
- 1014.3. The system should show to the customer manager the job opening list and job application list

**Client Clarifications**

> **Question:** When should it be possible to set this date? Will it be possible to schedule the interview only when the recruitment phase is at the intervenist stage? Or is it possible to score in other previous phases?
>
>  **Answer:** For me it may be possible to schedule interviews before but one should pay attention to whether the candidate "passed" the screening. It makes no sense to schedule an interview for a candidate who has not been accepted. Keep this type of aspect in mind.

> **Question:** Is it possible to schedule interviews for any day and time or we must take into account weekends, working hours and holidays, for example?
>
>  **Answer:** The system should display the day of the week for the selected date. But the system should accept any valid date.

> **Question:** When scheduling an interview with a candidate, should it be possible to schedule more than one interview per application?
>
> **Answer:** The system at this stage is thought to only support one interview per job Opening so it doesnâ€™t make much sense to schedule more than one interview for a candidate other than to reschedule the same interview (for example, the applicant was justifiably absent from a previous interview). In this context, I would say that it makes more sense to be able to change the appointment of an interview than to schedule more than one interview for the same candidate.

> **Question:** You enter a date and the system should guess the day of the week of this date and show it in the screen? I couldn't understand well.
>
> **Answer:** For the data entered by the user the system should display the day of the week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. It should not be a guess, but the true/real day of the week.





## 3. Analysis

*This main functionality is for the Customer Manager, so the user needs to be authenticated first to be able to record the time and date for an interview with a candidate.*

**System Sequence Diagram:**

## 4. Design
The principal function is to register a candidate, the input for the Operator consists of:

* Candidate Name
* Candidate Email
* Candidate Phone Number

After successfully submitting this information, the system should create a candidate and the corresponding user.

### 4.2. Class Diagram

### 4.3. Applied Patterns
* **Observer**
* **Repository**
* **Service**

> **Repository Pattern**
> * CandidateRepository
>
> **Justifications**
>
>The repositories were employed to persist candidates and usercandidates, as well as to reconstruct objects from the
persistence.


> **Service Pattern**
> * AuthorizationService
> * CandidateManagementService
> * UserManagementService
>
> **Justifications**
>
> The UserManagementService and AuthorizationService, pre-existing services within the Eapli.Framework were used here
> to register users and retrieve the logged-in user with Operator roles.
>
> The CandidateManagementService is employed to register candidates, tasked with the responsibility of
candidate creation.
>
> The mentioned services were developed because the functionalities they offer will be utilized across multiple use
> cases.

> **Observer**
> * EventPublisher
> * NewCandidateUserRegisteredEvent
> * NewCandidateUserRegisteredWatchDog
> * AddCandidateOnNewCandidateUserRegisteredController
>
> **Justifications**
>
> All the mentioned objects are components of the applied observer pattern. This pattern was implemented to ensure
> that when a new candidate is registered, a user is automatically registered as well. Following this procedure, upon the
> registration of a candidate, a NewCandidateUserRegisteredEvent instance is generated, and the EventPublisher is utilized
> to notify the WatchDog (Observer).
>
> Upon receiving this notification, the WatchDog triggers the registration of the
> user through the AddCandidateOnNewCandidateUserRegisteredController. 
>
> In this case, an instance of NewCandidateUserRegisteredEvent is used to inform the specific WatchDog,
> which then invokes the AddCandidateOnNewCandidateUserRegisteredController for the registration of the CandidateUser.
>
> To maintain consistency in the creation process, we used the EventPublisher within the service to
> ensure that both the candidate and its user were created, thus preserving the system's valid state.

### 4.4. Tests

**Test 1:** Verifies if equal users are detected

**Refers to Acceptance Criteria:** 2000a.1

````
    @Test
    public void ensureEqualsCandidateUsersPassesForSamePhoneNumber() throws Exception {

        final Candidate candidate1 = new Candidate(getNewDummyUser(),phoneNumber1);
        final Candidate candidate2 = new Candidate(getNewDummyUser(),phoneNumber1);

        final boolean expected = candidate1.equals(candidate2);

        assertTrue(expected);
    }

## 5. Implementation

### RegisterCandidateController

```
 public boolean registerCandidate(String name, String email, String extension, String number){
        Optional<SystemUser> operator = authz.loggedinUserWithPermissions(BaseRoles.OPERATOR);
        PhoneNumber phoneNumber = new PhoneNumber(extension, number);
        operator.ifPresent(systemUser -> candidateManagementService.registerCandidate(name, email, phoneNumber));

        return true;
    }
```
### CandidateManagementService

```
 public void registerCandidate(String name, String email, PhoneNumber phoneNumber) {
        String password = passwordService.generatePassword();

        final Set<Role> roles = new HashSet<>();
        roles.add(BaseRoles.CANDIDATE_USER);

        SystemUser sysUser = userManagementService.registerNewUser(email, password, name,"Candidate",email, roles);

        final DomainEvent event = new NewCandidateUserRegisteredEvent(sysUser,phoneNumber);
        dispatcher.publish(event);
    }
```
### NewCandidateUserRegisteredWatchDog

```
 @Override
    public void onEvent(final DomainEvent domainEvent) {
        assert domainEvent instanceof NewCandidateUserRegisteredEvent;

        final NewCandidateUserRegisteredEvent newCandidateUserRegisteredEvent = (NewCandidateUserRegisteredEvent) domainEvent;

        final AddCandidateOnNewCandidateUserRegisteredController controller = new AddCandidateOnNewCandidateUserRegisteredController();
        controller.registerNewCandidate(newCandidateUserRegisteredEvent);
    }
```
### AddCandidateOnNewCandidateUserRegisteredController

```
 public void registerNewCandidate(NewCandidateUserRegisteredEvent event) {
        candidateRepository.save(new Candidate(event.systemUser(), event.phoneNumber()));
    }
```
## 6. Integration/Demonstration
To execute this functionality it is necessary to run the script named `run-backoffice-app` and log in with Operator permissions
after it, must select the menu `Operator` followed by `Register a Candidate`.
