# US 1000

## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is being requested.

## 2. Requirements

> **US 1000** As {Administrator}, I want to be able to register, disable/enable, and list users of the backoffice.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **1000.1.** The user must have an email and password.

- **1000.2.** The password must have a minimum of 8 characters, including both upper and lowercase letters, digits, and
  at
  least one non-alphanumeric character.

- **1000.3.** After deactivated, a user must not have access to application until further alteration.

- **1000.4.** ...

**Dependencies/References:**

This functionality has a dependency on [_US G007_](../us_g007) that pertains to the authentication and authorization for
all users and functionalities.

_Reference 1000.1:_ Alternatively, this can be achieved by a bootstrap process.

**Client Clarifications:**

> **Question:** When creating a user in the system, it the name defined by the user or is it the person's first and last
> name?
> As for the password, is it defined by the user or generated by the system?
>
> **Answer:** In the User Stories 1000 and 1001 it is possible to manually enter passwords, but the same
> mechanism of automatic password generation described previously can be used. Concerning the name, it won't be used
> in the authentication process since the preferred user identifier is the email.

> **Question:** What is the user's enable/disable status?
>
> **Answer:** It pertains to the deactivation of the user's access to the system.

> **Question:** What are the business policies concerning password restrictions and email?
>
> **Answer:** The email can be any valid type of email. As for the password, it must meet the following criteria: a
> minimum of 8 characters, include both upper and lowercase letters, digits, and at least one non-alphanumeric
> character.

## 3. Analysis

This functionality centers around three main points: registration, enable/disable, and listing. In essence, this user
story comprises three functionalities.

Concerning user registration, a valid email is necessary, while the inclusion of a password is optional. Thus, the
Administrator should be given the option to either insert the password manually or allow it to be generated
automatically.

Furthermore, the client has established strict criteria for password composition. Consequently, if any of these criteria
are not met, the password must be rejected. In terms of the automation process, the system must only generate passwords
that adhere to these requirements.

> The enable and disable status of the user determines their access to the application. If they are disabled, the login
> process will fail, even if they are a valid user. **[This topic still needs further clarification]**

> Finally, concerning the listing of backoffice users, the required information to be displayed is:
> **[still needs to be clarified]**. The users must be ordered by: **[...]** in alphabetical order **[still needs to be clarified]**

## 4. Design

*In this sections, the team should present the solution design that was adopted to solve the requirement. This should
include, at least, a diagram of the realization of the functionality (e.g., sequence diagram), a class diagram (
presenting the classes that support the functionality), the identification and rational behind the applied design
patterns and the specification of the main tests used to validade the functionality.*

### 4.1. Realization

### 4.2. Class Diagram

![a class diagram]()

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

### 4.4. Tests

*Include here the main tests used to validate the functionality. Focus on how they relate to the acceptance criteria.*

**Test 1:** Verifies that it is not possible to ...

**Refers to Acceptance Criteria:** G002.1

````
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void ensureXxxxYyyy() {
...
}
````

## 5. Implementation

*In this section the team should present, if necessary, some evidencies that the implementation is according to the
design. It should also describe and explain other important artifacts necessary to fully understand the implementation
like, for instance, configuration files.*

*It is also a best practice to include a listing (with a brief summary) of the major commits regarding this
requirement.*

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

In this section the team should describe the efforts realized in order to integrate this functionality with the other
parts/components of the system

It is also important to explain any scripts or instructions required to execute an demonstrate this functionality

## 7. Observations

*This section should be used to include any content that does not fit any of the previous sections.*

*The team should present here, for instance, a critical prespective on the developed work including the analysis of
alternative solutioons or related works*

*The team should include in this section statements/references regarding third party works that were used in the
development this work.*
